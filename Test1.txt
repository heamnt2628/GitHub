The very large number of beetle species poses special problems for classification. 
Some families contain tens of thousands of species, and need to be divided into subfamilies and tribes. 
Polyphaga is the largest suborder, containing more than 300,000 described species in more than 170 families, including rove beetles (Staphylinidae), scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae)
, blister beetles (Meloidae), stag beetles (Lucanidae) and true weevils (Curculionidae).
[10][47] These polyphagan beetle groups can be identified by the presence of cervical sclerites (hardened parts of the head used as points of attachment for muscles) absent in the other suborders.
[48] Adephaga contains about 10 families of largely predatory beetles, includes ground beetles (Carabidae), water beetles (Dytiscidae) and whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae). 
In these insects, the testes are tubular and the first abdominal sternum (a plate of the exoskeleton) is divided by the hind coxae (the basal joints of the beetle's legs).
[49] Archostemata contains four families of mainly wood-eating beetles, including reticulated beetles (Cupedidae) and the telephone-pole beetle.
[50] The Archostemata have an exposed plate called the metatrochantin in front of the basal segment or coxa of the hind leg.
[51] Myxophaga contains about 65 described species in four families, mostly very small, including Hydroscaphidae and the genus Sphaerius.
[52] The myxophagan beetles are small and mostly alga-feeders. 
Their mouthparts are characteristic in lacking galeae and having a mobile tooth on their left mandible.[53]
The consistency of beetle morphology, in particular their possession of elytra, has long suggested that Coleoptera is monophyletic, 
though there have been doubts about the arrangement of the suborders, namely the Adephaga, Archostemata, Myxophaga and Polyphaga within that clade.
[54][32][55][56][57] The twisted-wing parasites, Strepsiptera, are thought to be a sister group to the beetles, having split from them in the Early Permian.[56][58][59][60]
Molecular phylogenetic analysis confirms that the Coleoptera are monophyletic. 
Duane McKenna et al. (2015) used eight nuclear genes for 367 species from 172 of 183 Coleopteran families. 
They split the Adephaga into 2 clades, Hydradephaga and Geadephaga, broke up the Cucujoidea into 3 clades, and placed the Lymexyloidea within the Tenebrionoidea. 
The Polyphaga appear to date from the Triassic. 
Most extant beetle families appear to have arisen in the Cretaceous.
[60] The cladogram is based on McKenna (2015).
[60] The number of species in each group (mainly superfamilies) is shown in parentheses, and boldface if over 10,000.
[61] English common names are given where possible. Dates of origin of major groups are shown in italics in millions of years ago (mya).[61]
